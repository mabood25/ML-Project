EDA & ML Tips:
Handling Missing Data:

Instead of imputing missing age data, multiple linear regression was utilized.
Extensive dataset research led to discovering missing embarkation data online.
Creating Dummy Variables:

Significant use of pd.get_dummies for Sex, Pclass, Embarked, and Survived variables. Improves interpretability and aids the training set.
Note: Changing the 'Survived' variable to categorical is essential for the final logistic regression.
